(Chapter 28: "A Bag of Coins and a Broken Promise")
Expanded Summary
The chapter follows Jin in the immediate aftermath of his encounter with Lady Amira at the masquerade ball. He returns to his squalid room in the slums of Metal City, the weight of his impossible choice pressing down on him. His younger sister, Mei, wakes up, and they share a quiet, intimate moment that underscores the deep bond between them and the immense stakes of Jin's decision.

Mei, with the simple, powerful morality of a child, senses Jin's distress. He poses a hypothetical question to her about being offered money to do something terrible to help someone you love. Mei, remembering their deceased mother's lessons, insists that being bad will only make you "poor inside" and that they should find another way. Her innocent faith in their ability to overcome their situation stands in stark contrast to the ruthless reality Jin is facing. The conversation leaves Jin more torn than ever, caught between his mother's memory and the very real threat to his sister's life.

The core of the chapter is Jin's internal struggle. He is tormented by his choice: take Lady Amira's "blood money" to save Mei from the gang leader Old Crow, thereby becoming an accomplice in a political conspiracy, or refuse and risk Lady Amira making good on her threat to have Mei sold off. He grapples with the memory of their mother's teachings about goodness versus the harsh, pragmatic need to protect his family at any cost.

He spends a sleepless night watching over his sister, the bag of coins from Lady Amira a heavy, tangible symbol of his dilemma. He understands that either path is a gamble with Mei's future. The chapter ends as dawn breaks over Metal City, with Jin still undecided, knowing that he has only hours to make the hardest decision of his life.
