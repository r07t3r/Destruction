(Chapter 15: "A Titan's Fall")
Expanded Summary
The chapter shifts to the war front between the Hidden Cloud and the Hidden Stone. The Third Raikage, a powerful, titan-like figure, stands on a ridge overlooking a canyon where his advisor, Kichonis, reports that the Tsuchikage, Onoki, is hiding with a large force of Stone ninjas. Filled with immense pride and confidence in his own power, the Raikage dismisses his escort, declaring, "Alone, I am an army."

Onoki reveals himself, and a massive battle erupts as hundreds of Stone shinobi pour out from the canyon. The Raikage becomes a force of nature, a whirlwind of lightning and fury. He unleashes his signature "Hell Stab" technique, tearing through the enemy ranks with devastating power. The battle is brutal and rages for two full days, with the Raikage single-handedly holding off and decimating the Stone army.

In the aftermath, as the rain falls on a battlefield littered with corpses, the exhausted Raikage is confronted by Kichonis. In a shocking turn, Kichonis reveals his treachery and attacks his weakened leader, stating he has his own vision for the Cloud's future. The Raikage, though heartbroken by the betrayal, musters his last reserves of strength. In a final, explosive act, he kills Kichonis with a black lightning strike but collapses and dies immediately after, his energy completely spent.

Watching from a safe distance, Onoki witnesses the Raikage's fall. Acknowledging the ruin, he retreats into the night, a survivor who has achieved his objective. The chapter concludes in the Hidden Cloud Village, where news of the Raikage's death has created a power vacuum. Amid the grief, the village elders and commanders grapple with the political fallout and the threat of their enemies, while a new, bitter resolve for retribution begins to form.
