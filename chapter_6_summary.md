(Chapter 6: "The Baptism of Ash")
Expanded Summary
The chapter opens with the Sand Village initiating its first covert moves, marking the quiet beginning of the war. The focus then shifts to Raghoul, who has left the monastery and is now traveling alone through the desolate badlands. He is armed with an obsidian sword and his unique, blood-red fire jutsu.

During a stop, he senses the clumsy approach of three figures. He quickly identifies them as Leaf shinobi, but also realizes they are barely Genin—scared children rushed into service. Despite this, when the oldest boy, in a moment of terror, throws a kunai at him, Raghoul's training and survival instincts take over completely. He moves with brutal efficiency and slaughters all three children in seconds. The fight is a merciless, one-sided massacre.

Initially, Raghoul feels only the cold satisfaction of survival. This changes when he inspects the bodies. He discovers the small, personal effects they carried: a locket with a crudely drawn family picture, a half-written letter to a mother promising to make her proud, and a half-eaten piece of candy saved for later. This discovery of their lost innocence and dreams shatters him. He is overcome with guilt and physical revulsion, dropping to his knees and vomiting until his throat is raw. The Abbot's warning—"The innocent die the loudest"—echoes in his mind, and he realizes how unprepared he was for the emotional weight of taking a life.

He sits with the corpses for hours, eventually closing their eyes in a small, final act of mercy. He understands that thousands of children just like them are being fed into the war machine by all the great nations. That night, he burns the unsent letter, and in the fire, his naivete and hesitation are burned away as well. He makes a cold resolution: to survive the cruel world, he must become crueler. The boy who left the monastery is gone, replaced by a hardened weapon marching toward the thunder of the war drums.

Plot Point Analysis
*   **Raghoul's First Kill:** The central event of the chapter is Raghoul's first real combat, which is against child soldiers.
    *   **Significance:** This is his "baptism by fire." It's not a glorious battle but a traumatic, messy slaughter that strips away any romantic notions of power and violence. This experience is the true beginning of his journey into the dark world of the shinobi.

*   **The Discovery of Innocence:** After the killing, Raghoul's discovery of the children's personal belongings forces him to confront their humanity.
    *   **Significance:** This is the emotional core of the chapter and a pivotal moment for his character. It prevents him from becoming a simple, remorseless killer. His profound guilt and sickness show that he is not inherently evil, but his subsequent resolution shows him choosing to suppress that part of himself to survive.

*   **The Death of Naivete and a New Resolve:** Raghoul's emotional breakdown gives way to a cold, hard resolution to become "worse" than the world he inhabits.
    *   **Significance:** This marks a critical transformation. The naive boy is dead, and in his place is a self-aware weapon forged by trauma. His motivation is no longer just a vague desire for power but a calculated decision rooted in a brutal first-hand lesson about the nature of his world.

*   **Critique of the Shinobi System:** The narrative explicitly frames the use of child soldiers as a systemic issue across all nations, not just a single evil act.
    *   **Significance:** This reinforces the story's overarching anti-war theme. Raghoul's personal tragedy is presented as a microcosm of a global atrocity, making the entire shinobi system the true antagonist.
