(Chapter 3: "Forest of Hollow Graves")
Expanded Summary
The chapter follows a three-person genin squad from the Hidden Rock Village—Mita, Gora, and Ayano—on an intelligence mission deep within the Land of Fire. The mission goes horribly wrong when their underground hideout is discovered and destroyed by an elite unit from Konoha's Anbu, the "Dark Department." The squad is forced to flee for their lives through a dark, menacing forest.

Despite their desperate, two-hour flight, they are eventually cornered. The Anbu, wearing goat masks and moving with terrifying, mechanical precision, emerge from the shadows. Their leader, a figure in black robes with a blood-red katana, gives the simple, cold order to "Kill." The genin squad, hopelessly outmatched, prepares for their final stand.

As the first Anbu blade comes for him, Mita experiences a flashback to his last conversation with his pregnant partner, Muthu, in the Hidden Rock Village. She had begged him not to go, but he insisted it was his duty, expressing a fatalistic desire to die a meaningful death on the battlefield rather than "rot away" at home. He left her with the hope that their unborn child would not have to live by the blade.

The battle is a swift and brutal slaughter. Mita is killed instantly. Ayano's desperate attack is met with a broken wrist before she is cut down, and Gora is disemboweled. The Anbu show no emotion as they methodically seal the bodies and all the intelligence they carried into black scrolls, erasing any trace of their existence and their mission.

The narrative cuts away to the Hidden Rock Village, where Muthu wakes up screaming from a nightmare in which the earth swallowed the sun and a blade hovered over her child's crib, sensing her partner's death.

Back in the forest, the Goat-Masked Anbu leader lingers for a moment, a flicker of a memory stirring within him of a time when he was the hunted, not the hunter. He ruthlessly suppresses the thought, reaffirming his commitment to duty and death. He vanishes, leaving only the scent of blood and burnt paper. The chapter concludes with the ominous feeling that something ancient and malevolent in the forest has been awakened by the bloodshed, feeding on the sorrow.

Plot Point Analysis
*   **The Hopeless Chase:** The chapter opens with the Rock-nin squad already defeated and fleeing for their lives, establishing a tone of dread and inevitability.
    *   **Significance:** This immediately frames the characters as victims of a larger, merciless system. Their struggle and inevitable failure highlight the brutal power disparity between standard shinobi and elite black ops units.

*   **Humanizing the "Enemy" (Mita's Flashback):** The flashback to Mita's farewell with his pregnant partner, Muthu, provides the emotional core of the chapter.
    *   **Significance:** This forces the reader to empathize with the "antagonist" side of the brewing conflict. Mita is not a faceless enemy soldier but a man with a family and a tragic sense of duty. His death becomes a personal tragedy, reinforcing the theme that war victimizes everyone.

*   **The Swift, Impersonal Execution:** The fight is not a glorious battle but a one-sided massacre. The Anbu operate with cold, detached efficiency, sealing the bodies to erase them from history.
    *   **Significance:** This demonstrates the dehumanizing nature of the Anbu and the state they serve. The act of sealing the bodies is particularly cruel, as it denies the victims even a grave, turning their lives into nothing more than a failed, classified mission.

*   **The Ripple Effect of Grief (Muthu's Nightmare):** The scene cutting to Muthu waking from a nightmare serves as a supernatural echo of the tragedy.
    *   **Significance:** This connects the violence on the front lines to the suffering at home, showing that death creates waves of grief. It parallels Raghoul's prophetic vision, suggesting a world where deep emotional events have a tangible, almost psychic impact.

*   **A Glimpse into the Executioner's Past:** The Goat-Masked Anbu leader's brief, suppressed memory hints that he was once in the same position as his victims.
    *   **Significance:** This adds a crucial layer of complexity to the character, suggesting he is not simply evil but a product of the same violent cycle. It raises the question of whether he is a monster or another victim who survived by becoming a tool of the system.
