(Chapter 5: "The Creed of the Forsaken")
Expanded Summary
The chapter shifts to the Village Hidden in the Sand, Sunagakure, where one of its two Supreme Elders, Ebizo, watches the sunset. He is a cold, calculating leader who lives by the Sand's ruthless creed: survival and glory without illusions in a world that has abandoned them. His meditation is interrupted by the arrival of the monstrous eagle from Chapter 1. It delivers a scroll containing the severed head of Kisaru Uchiha and a simple, provocative message: "War sings. What will the Wind respond?"

This act serves as the catalyst within a village already primed for conflict. The chapter details the harsh, brutal culture of Sunagakure, a place where children learn to kill before they can read and survival is the only true virtue. The narrative then introduces the second Supreme Elder, Chiyo, a legendary puppet master known as the "Puppet-Witch." She is consumed by a deep, personal hatred for the Hidden Leaf Village, and specifically for Sakumo Hatake (the "White Fang of the Leaf"), who killed her son and daughter-in-law. In her workshop, surrounded by grotesque puppets, she puts the finishing touches on a new weapon made from the bones of a captured Leaf jonin, an instrument for her revenge.

In the Council Hall, Ebizo and Chiyo meet to discuss their next move. Their dynamic represents the two sides of the Sand's will: Ebizo's cold pragmatism, which seeks a tangible victory, and Chiyo's burning rage, which desires nothing less than the complete annihilation of the Leaf.

The chapter paints a grim picture of the entire ninja world, condemning all five Great Nations as hypocritical powers that preach peace while committing atrocities. The Leaf assassinates leaders, the Mist purges its own people, and so on. This reinforces the idea that there are no heroes, only different shades of villainy.

The chapter closes with Chiyo whispering a vow to her completed bone puppet, dedicating its future slaughter to her lost children. The wind howls through the village, carrying the scent of blood and dust, as the Sand prepares to answer the call to war with merciless terror.

Plot Point Analysis
*   **The Message is Received:** The arrival of Kisaru's head in Sunagakure directly links the Sand Village to the inciting incident of the story. It is the formal challenge that pushes them from preparation into action.
    *   **Significance:** This confirms that the golden-eyed man's actions were intended to provoke the Sand into a war with the Leaf, officially setting the two major powers on a collision course.

*   **Establishing the Sand's Duality (Ebizo and Chiyo):** The chapter introduces the two leaders of the village, who embody two different motivations for war: Ebizo's calculated, strategic pragmatism and Chiyo's raw, grief-fueled vengeance.
    *   **Significance:** This creates a complex and dangerous political landscape within the Sand. Their war will be fought with both cold logic and unrestrained hatred, making them an unpredictable and formidable foe.

*   **Humanizing the Aggressor (Chiyo's Backstory):** Chiyo's all-consuming hatred is given a tragic and relatable origin: the murder of her family by a famous Leaf ninja.
    *   **Significance:** This continues the theme of cyclical violence and blurs the lines between protagonist and antagonist. The Sand's aggression is not baseless; it is born from its own deep wounds, making the impending conflict a tragedy for both sides.

*   **Condemnation of the Shinobi World System:** The narrator explicitly states that all five Great Nations are corrupt and hypocritical, engaging in the very acts of violence they publicly condemn in others.
    *   **Significance:** This elevates the story's theme beyond a simple "Sand vs. Leaf" conflict. It frames the entire world order as a rotten system where war is inevitable because every major power is built on a foundation of violence and lies.
