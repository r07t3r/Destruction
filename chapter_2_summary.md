(Chapter 2: "The Storm Inside")
Expanded Summary
The chapter shifts focus to a desolate desert hut where a young boy named Raghoul is in a state of deep, painful meditation. He is gaunt, cold, and exhausted, struggling to control a powerful, chaotic energy within him—a "storm" his former mentor, a now-deceased monk, had called "chakra." The monk had warned him in his dying words to "still the storm" or it would destroy him. Driven by a desperate need for power, Raghoul attempts to follow this advice, turning his focus inward.

Instead of finding peace, he is plunged into a terrifying, apocalyptic vision. He witnesses a diseased, bloated sun falling from the sky, crashing into the earth and unleashing a torrent of fire that splits the ground, boils rivers, and incinerates cities. He hears the collective scream of a million dying souls as the world is consumed by the inferno. The vision feels intensely real, and he understands it not as a dream, but as a "memory of the future"—a prophecy of his own fate unless he can master his power first. He feels himself being burned alive before he violently snaps back to reality.

Shaken and drenched in sweat, Raghoul stumbles out of his hut to a nearby oasis. The cold water brings him back to his senses. Staring at his reflection—a boy with a scarred body and haunted, hateful eyes—he confronts his own despair and weakness. He touches a prominent scar on his throat, whispering that he "should have died." However, this moment of weakness transforms into one of defiant resolve.

He rises to his feet and makes a solemn vow to the empty desert and the cold stars. He declares that he will not die forgotten in the wasteland. He will survive, grow strong, and learn to control his power. His ultimate goal, he proclaims, is to one day become strong enough to "burn it all down." The chapter ends as he embraces the storm within him, no longer just a victim of his circumstances but a boy ready to unleash his own destructive potential upon the world. The sky itself seems to shudder in response, acknowledging the coming storm.

Plot Point Analysis
*   **Introducing Raghoul and his Internal Conflict:** The chapter formally introduces Raghoul, the boy hinted at in Chapter 1. His primary struggle is established as an internal one: a battle to control a dangerous, latent power ("the storm," or chakra) that threatens to consume him.
    *   **Significance:** This immediately establishes Raghoul as a character defined by immense potential and immense risk. His journey will be about mastering this power, for good or ill.

*   **The Apocalyptic Vision:** Raghoul's meditation triggers a prophetic vision of world-ending destruction caused by a falling sun.
    *   **Significance:** This is a major piece of foreshadowing that sets the ultimate stakes for the entire narrative. It suggests that the conflict initiated in Chapter 1 is merely a precursor to a much larger, cataclysmic event that may be directly linked to Raghoul and his power.

*   **The Vow at the Oasis:** After the vision, Raghoul moves from a state of suffering to one of purpose. He looks at his scarred reflection and makes a conscious decision to survive and accumulate power, culminating in a vow to "burn it all down."
    *   **Significance:** This is the character's pivotal turning point. It solidifies his motivation and sets him on a dark, ambitious path. He is no longer just a survivor; he is an aspiring destroyer, framing him as a potential anti-hero or future antagonist.

*   **Establishing a Parallel Narrative:** The chapter deliberately shifts the focus away from the Hidden Leaf and the golden-eyed man to Raghoul's isolated struggle in the desert.
    *   **Significance:** This creates a second, parallel storyline. The reader is now following two distinct threads—the political/military conflict brewing from Chapter 1, and Raghoul's personal journey of power—which are destined to intersect.

    *   **Strengths:** Possesses immense, untamed latent power (chakra). He has incredible willpower and a capacity to endure extreme suffering (cold, hunger, pain). His defining strength is his ultimate refusal to surrender, instead channeling his pain into a ruthless drive for power.
