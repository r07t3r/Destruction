(Chapter 7: "Songs Never Sung")
Expanded Summary
This chapter is split into two distinct but thematically connected parts.

The first half is a heartbreaking flashback dedicated to the three young Leaf genin Raghoul killed in the previous chapter. It reveals their names—Rita, Mishu, and Kiswa—and paints a vivid picture of their innocent lives in Konohagakure. Rita was a fierce, aspiring medical ninja who dreamed of saving everyone. Mishu was a gentle baker's son who wanted to be a "shield" to protect his friends. Kiswa was a clever young prankster who dreamed of being a master of infiltration. They shared a bond of friendship and a promise to grow old together. This idyllic life was shattered when they were conscripted for a critical infiltration mission they were not prepared for, driven by duty and the fear of shaming their families. The narrative then recounts their final, terrified moments from their own perspectives, culminating in their swift deaths at the hands of Raghoul, whom they perceive as an inhuman "devil" of red fire. The section ends with Raghoul sitting with their bodies, haunted by what he has done. He internalizes the brutal lesson that "in this world... even children kill. And even children die," and his grief hardens into a resolve to become strong enough that he will never be a victim.

The second half of the chapter returns to the inner council chambers of the Hidden Sand Village. Ebizo and Chiyo preside over a meeting with their top jonin commanders. The mood is tense and vengeful. They discuss the weakness and corruption of their own feudal lord, the Daimyo, who profits while sending their people to die. While some commanders advocate for assassination, Chiyo and Ebizo dismiss it as too risky, potentially leading to a civil war. Instead, Ebizo proposes a more ruthless and pragmatic strategy: since their own nation will not provide for them, they will take what they need from their enemies. They decide to launch raids on the supply lines of the Land of Fire and the poorly defended towns of the Land of Earth, bleeding their enemies dry. The chapter concludes with Chiyo's chilling declaration that the world will remember the "rage of the desert."

Plot Point Analysis
*   **Giving a Voice to the Victims:** The chapter deliberately shifts perspective to the slain children, detailing their lives, dreams, and friendships.
    *   **Significance:** This is a powerful narrative choice that drives home the story's anti-war theme. The children are no longer faceless casualties; they are fully realized characters whose deaths are a profound tragedy. This forces the reader to confront the human cost of Raghoul's actions and the shinobi system as a whole.

*   **Finalizing Raghoul's Transformation:** By showing the aftermath from Raghoul's perspective—his guilt mixing with his resolve—the chapter completes his "baptism of ash."
    *   **Significance:** His decision to become "stronger" and "colder" is now contextualized. It's not born of malice, but of a traumatic lesson in the world's brutality. He is not becoming evil; he is shedding the parts of himself he believes will get him killed.

*   **The Sand's War Strategy Solidified:** The Sand Council meeting moves the plot forward by establishing their precise plan of attack: a war of attrition and plunder against their neighbors.
    *   **Significance:** This defines the nature of the coming conflict. The Sand will not engage in honorable, pitched battles but in guerilla warfare, raids, and economic disruption, making them a different kind of threat.

*   **Internal Politics of the Sand:** The debate over assassinating their own Daimyo reveals the deep internal fractures within the Land of Wind. The shinobi see the nobility as corrupt parasites.
    *   **Significance:** This adds political complexity to the Sand's motivations. Their war is not just about external grudges but also about their own internal desperation and resentment toward their rulers, making their actions a bid for self-preservation and autonomy.

Character List and Analysis
*   **Rita, Mishu, and Kiswa**
    *   **Affiliation:** Konohagakure (Hidden Leaf Village).
    *   **Status:** Deceased.
    *   **Strengths/Role:** Serve as the emotional core of the chapter. They embody the innocence and potential destroyed by the shinobi system. Their story is a powerful indictment of the practice of using child soldiers and provides the tragic foundation for Raghoul's hardened worldview.

*   **Raghoul**
    *   **Affiliation:** None.
    *   **Status:** Alive.
    *   **Strengths/Role:** In this chapter, his role is to be the unwilling instrument of tragedy and then to process its aftermath. His internal struggle between guilt and the need for self-preservation is central, culminating in his final resolve to embrace a colder path.

*   **Ebizo**
    *   **Affiliation:** Sunagakure (Supreme Elder).
    *   **Status:** Alive.
    *   **Strengths/Role:** The voice of cold, calculated pragmatism. He steers the council's rage away from a self-destructive civil war and channels it into a focused, strategic war against their enemies. He represents the mind of the Sand's war machine.

*   **Chiyo**
    *   **Affiliation:** Sunagakure (Supreme Elder).
    *   **Status:** Alive.
    *   **Strengths/Role:** The voice of pure, unadulterated vengeance. Her hatred gives the Sand's strategic plans their moral (or immoral) justification. She represents the soul of the Sand's war machine.
