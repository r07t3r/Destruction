(Chapter 35: "The Yukigakure Accord")
Expanded Summary
The chapter opens a week after the "Day Zero" event, with the world's most powerful leaders gathering for an unprecedented emergency summit in the frozen Land of Snow. The atmosphere is one of immense tension and barely concealed fear. The Five Kage—Hiruzen Sarutobi (Konoha), Rasa (Suna), Yagura (Kiri), A (Kumo), and Onoki (Iwa)—are all present, along with the legendary leader of the Rain, Hanzo. Their usual arrogance and rivalry have been replaced by a grim, shared terror.

The summit begins with Hiruzen acknowledging the global tremor that every shinobi on the planet felt. Minato Namikaze then gives his harrowing firsthand account of his encounter with Raghoul at the ruins of Rōran. He describes Raghoul absorbing the Dragon Vein and radiating a power so immense and alien that his every instinct screamed at him to flee. Minato, the legendary Yellow Flash, admitting to this level of fear sends a shockwave of dread through the assembled leaders.

Jiraiya follows up, using his vast experience to contextualize the threat. He explains that Raghoul's chakra feels fundamentally "wrong," something that doesn't belong in their reality, and warns that if he returns, he won't just kill them—he will "unmake" them. The other Kage share their own grim reports: Rasa lost two elite scouting teams whose chakra networks were burned out from the inside, and the Raikage admits that this is a threat beyond anything they have ever conceived of.

The debate turns to how to counter this existential threat. The leaders, stripped of their usual political posturing, are forced into a state of desperate cooperation. They agree to form an unprecedented alliance, codified as the "Yukigakure Accord." The key tenets of the accord are: the formation of a Joint Task Force with the best shinobi from every village, the establishment of a real-time global communication network to report any strange phenomena, and a universal protection pact for all civilians, regardless of village affiliation.

Just as they are about to formalize the pact, Hanzo speaks for the first time, cutting through their planning with a cold dose of reality. He questions whether they will even have time to implement their grand plans, pointing out that this new enemy could strike at any moment. His words hang in the air like a death sentence. Nevertheless, Onoki brings the gavel down, declaring the age of petty politics over and the Third Great Ninja War officially begun—this time, against a common, world-ending foe.

The chapter ends with a poignant cutaway to the Konoha Ninja Academy, where a group of eight-year-old students, including Kei and his friends, discuss the fearful rumors they've overheard from their parents and teachers. They understand that something terrible has happened and that the adults are scared. Their childish conversation about a "great evil" and the possibility of all villages fighting together serves as a powerful, innocent counterpoint to the grim reality of the Kage summit, highlighting what is truly at stake: the future of the next generation.
