(Chapter 1: "Blood for Blood")
Expanded Summary
The story opens in a vast, sun-scorched desert in the Kingdom of Wind. A ninja named Kisaru, grievously wounded and exhausted, is fleeing for his life. Bleeding from a deep gash in his side, he struggles through the dunes, his throat raw from shouting at his unseen pursuer. The environment is brutal and unforgiving, mirroring his desperate situation.

His flight is cut short as a man with cold, golden eyes appears and presses a blade to his throat. The man speaks in "wind tongue," a language Kisaru doesn't understand, before switching to a broken dialect. He accuses Kisaru, an Uchiha, of killing someone named Jhinra and declares that vengeance is due. Kisaru, defiant even in defeat, laughs and taunts his killer to finish the job. With a swift, cruel motion, the golden-eyed man slits Kisaru's throat.

As Kisaru collapses and dies, his life flashes before his eyes. The memories are not of the desert hell, but of his home, the Hidden Leaf Village. He sees his two best friends, the reckless Nioshi ("Yoshi") and the more cautious Yamapo, laughing and running through the village as children. He recalls them carving their names into a stone, making a foolish, sacred promise to be "brothers forever" and to "burn the fucking world down" if any one of them were to fall. The promise was "Blood for blood."

The memory shifts to the mission where this promise was invoked. During a routine patrol, their squad was ambushed, and Yoshi was killed by a ninja named Jhinra. In his dying moments, Yoshi reminded Kisaru of their oath. Driven by grief and rage, Kisaru's Sharingan awakened, but it was too late to save his friend. He later hunted down Jhinra and killed him, fulfilling the promise.

Returning to the present, the golden-eyed man stands over Kisaru's corpse. In a cold, methodical ritual, he decapitates Kisaru and seals the head within a black, leathery scroll made of human skin. He then summons a monstrous, iron-feathered eagle, straps the scroll to its leg, and sends it flying toward the horizon.

As the eagle disappears, the man whispers a chilling monologue to the desert, declaring that "The fuse has been lit" and that his "Lord is dead" and "The world is guilty." He vows to remind the world of forgotten wars. The chapter concludes by noting that far away, a boy named Raghoul is disturbed in his sleep by nightmares, as the world, unaware, teeters on the brink of a new conflict. The age of peace is over.
