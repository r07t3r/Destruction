(Chapter 10: "The Baptism of Ash")
Expanded Summary
Two months after the massacre in the Land of Rain, a traumatized Raghoul wanders the wasteland, haunted by the faces of those he has killed and by apocalyptic visions of a falling red sun. His journey leads him to a war camp of Sand mercenaries and Land of Black Snow shinobi. The force's commander, a ruthless veteran named Kashin, senses Raghoul's power and offers him work as a mercenary in their upcoming attack on the Kingdom of Scorpions. With nothing left to lose, Raghoul accepts.

The dawn attack is a chaotic and savage slaughter. Raghoul moves through the battle with cold, mechanical efficiency, his cursed red flame turning his blade into an instrument of pure death. He kills without hesitation, cutting down a young soldier begging for his life and a veteran Scorpion captain who recognizes the "rot" in Raghoul's soul. The battle is depicted with graphic brutality, emphasizing the complete absence of honor and the visceral reality of war.

In the aftermath, Raghoul feels only a growing emptiness. He witnesses a young ninja vomit after his first kill and lies, telling him he'll "get used to it." He overhears the commanders casually planning their next massacre, including the murder of civilians, which they laugh about. His despair is briefly interrupted by a conversation with an old, cynical earth ninja who lost his own son in a previous war. The veteran tells Raghoul there is no glory in war, "just meat and metal and the lies we tell ourselves to keep swinging our swords."

The second day's battle against a supply depot is even more brutal. Raghoul's power is on full display as he single-handedly slaughters a squad of elite Scorpion warriors. In a fleeting moment of empathy, he whispers "I'm sorry" to the last one he kills, but immediately resolves it will be the last time. After the hollow victory, he encounters a dying teenage Scorpion prisoner who asks him, "Why?" Raghoul kneels beside him and delivers his new, bleak worldview: "Because the world is broken." The chapter ends with Raghoul marching onward with the army, having fully embraced his new identity as a weapon, a being no longer fully human, ready for the endless war.

Plot Point Analysis
*   **Raghoul Becomes a Mercenary:** Raghoul makes a conscious choice to join a mercenary army, moving from a lone survivor to an active participant in the war machine.
    *   **Significance:** This is a major turning point that accelerates his descent. By selling his blade, he normalizes the act of killing and fully immerses himself in the brutal, amoral culture of war, speeding up his dehumanization.

*   **The Dehumanization of the Soldiers:** The chapter graphically details the psychological impact of constant violence. The commanders' casual cruelty and the young soldier's sickness after his first kill illustrate the process of desensitization.
    *   **Significance:** This reinforces one of the story's central themes: war doesn't just kill bodies; it systematically destroys the humanity of its participants, turning them into empty, violent shells.

*   **The Veteran's Cynical Wisdom:** The conversation with the old earth ninja provides an explicit, in-world articulation of the story's philosophy.
    *   **Significance:** It confirms that the narrative's perspective is one of grim realism. The old soldier acts as a "ghost of the future," showing Raghoul the only possible end for a man on his path: a long life filled with loss and devoid of meaning.

*   **The Final Apology and Hardening:** Raghoul's whispered "I'm sorry" to a victim, immediately followed by the internal promise to never do it again, is a deliberate act of killing off his own empathy.
    *   **Significance:** This marks the final, conscious step in his transformation. He is actively choosing to become a monster to survive, which is more tragic than simply being worn down by violence. It is a suicide of the soul.

*   **"The World is Broken":** Raghoul's answer to the dying boy's question, "Why?", serves as his new, solidified thesis on life.
    *   **Significance:** This phrase encapsulates his entire worldview. He has moved past trying to understand or fix the world and has accepted its state of inherent brutality. He will now act according to these brutal rules, making him a truly dangerous and unpredictable force.
