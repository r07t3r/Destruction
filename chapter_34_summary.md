(Chapter 34: "The Harvest and the Flame")
Expanded Summary
The chapter opens with Raghoul standing in the glassed-over ruins of R≈çran, trying to process his transformation. The Dragon Vein's energy has fully merged with his own, rewriting his very existence. This fusion triggers another, more violent and expansive cosmic vision. His consciousness is torn from his body and dragged through a chaotic multiverse. He witnesses countless other realities, each a different flavor of horror: a world ruled by soul-eating demons, a battlefield where the gods of human mythology slaughter each other, a sterile digital reality of eternal loneliness, and a world of flesh-eating giants. The experience is overwhelming, a sensory and psychological assault that shatters his remaining human perspective.

When he returns to his body, he is fundamentally changed. The experience has not broken him, but has instead given him a terrifying clarity and a new, detailed understanding of his own powers. He now possesses a suite of god-like abilities: he can rewind time by sixty seconds, manipulate reality on a fundamental level, erase matter from existence with his evolved flame, and open doorways to other dimensions. He also understands that his human form is now just a containment vessel for his true self: a fifty-foot-tall being of living apocalypse.

However, his journey through the multiverse also gave him a humbling and terrifying glimpse of the true cosmic hierarchy. He remembers the ancient, nameless entities he saw in the void, beings whose power dwarfed his own, who could destroy galaxies with a thought. This knowledge, rather than intimidating him, fuels his ambition. He realizes that even his newfound godhood is just a single step on a much longer path.

With this new perspective, a grand, horrifying plan forms in his mind. First, he will conquer his home world, subjugating every village and turning the entire shinobi world into his personal army. Then, he will use this army to "harvest" the multiverse, invading other dimensions to strip them of their resources, knowledge, and life force to fuel his own ascension. His ultimate goal is to achieve true omnipotence, to become a being that even the ancient horrors of the void will be forced to respect.

The chapter concludes with Raghoul putting his plan into motion. He uses his reality-warping powers to raise a massive, living citadel of obsidian and bone from the glassed desert, "Fortress Zero," the first monument to his new reign. Standing atop it, he declares the end of the age of shinobi and the beginning of his own "age of Harvest and Flame." As he speaks, the sky above him cracks, revealing not stars, but the black void of the multiverse, a sign that his ambition has already begun to reshape reality.
