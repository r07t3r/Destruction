(Chapter 36: "The First Harvest World")
Expanded Summary
The chapter opens with Raghoul standing alone atop Fortress Zero, the massive, living citadel he has willed into existence in the ruins of R≈çran. The world around him is silent and still, held in thrall by his immense power. He approaches the portal he created, a perfect circle of blackness framed by pulsating runes. With a touch, he activates it. The portal awakens like a malevolent eye, and Raghoul steps through without hesitation, beginning the first phase of his grand plan: the harvest of the multiverse.

The transition is a violent, disorienting tear in reality. When he lands, he finds himself in a hellish dimension he identifies as Naraq-Zhul. The landscape is a testament to eternal suffering: the ground is a hard-packed beach of gray sand made from the crushed bones and ashes of countless souls, and the sky is a roiling canvas of sickly, unnatural colors. A vast sea beside him is not water, but a swirling mass of molten metal and liquid light, radiating the raw emotion of every soul that ever drowned in it.

As he takes in the desolate landscape, Raghoul accesses the memories of his past life as Justin Olamilekan. He recalls reading about demonology and the Seventy-Two Kings of Hell as described in the Goetia of King Solomon. He recognizes this place and its hierarchy, but scoffs at the "power" of these demons, which he now sees as pathetically limited compared to his own.

His presence is soon detected by the dimension's natives: the Cinderborn. These are the lowest form of demon, translucent, hungry souls who have been broken down by eons of punishment. They drift towards him, driven by instinct. Raghoul demonstrates his new, terrifying power by effortlessly "unmaking" the first Cinderborn that approaches, erasing its very existence from reality with a touch of his refined flame.

The other Cinderborn are stunned into a moment of clarity. Raghoul then exerts his will upon them, not with force, but with the sheer, undeniable authority of his new being. They are compelled to obey. He interrogates them, and they reveal the structure of this realm: a place of seven tiers, ruled by seventy-two kings, archdukes, and princes of darkness. They tell him that this first tier is ruled by Duke Asmodeus from his Brass Citadel. With a clear target identified, Raghoul sends the Cinderborn out as heralds, ordering them to spread the word of his arrival to their "betters." The chapter ends with Raghoul walking deeper into Hell, a confident conqueror ready to begin his harvest by dismantling the old order, one demon king at a time.

Plot Point Analysis
*   **The First Step of the Harvest:** Raghoul activating the portal and stepping into another dimension is the first concrete action of his multiversal conquest plan.
    *   **Significance:** This moves the story from planning to execution, officially beginning the "Harvest and Flame" arc. The conquest of Hell is his first campaign and will serve as the testing ground for his new powers and ambitions.

    *   **Significance:** This is a crucial character beat that shows his reincarnation is not just a source of trauma but a powerful strategic asset. He can draw on the knowledge of all his past lives, making him incredibly adaptable and well-informed in any reality he enters.

*   **Establishing Absolute Dominion:** Raghoul doesn't just defeat the Cinderborn; he commands them with his will alone, turning them into his servants.
    *   **Significance:** This demonstrates a new aspect of his power. He is not just a destroyer; he is a master. His ability to command lesser beings with his mere presence establishes him as a true ruler and conqueror, not just a rampaging monster.

*   **The First Target is Named:** The identification of Duke Asmodeus as the ruler of this tier gives Raghoul a clear, immediate objective for his conquest.
    *   **Significance:** This grounds the cosmic-scale plot with a tangible, near-term goal. The story now has a specific antagonist for Raghoul to overcome, providing a clear path and raising anticipation for the next phase of the narrative.
