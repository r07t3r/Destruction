(Chapter 16: "The Lake of Broken Promises")
Expanded Summary
Three years after the events of the previous chapters, the narrative finds an older, more hardened Raghoul in the Land of Birds, a desolate wasteland littered with corpses and ruled by despair. He meets Musashi, a cynical and guilt-ridden Samaritan healer, in a landscape defined by brutal violence and suffering. Raghoul is a cold, nihilistic killer, while Musashi desperately tries to save lives, though he is jaded by his own past failures, having lost his family to the very suffering he now fights.

The chapter is a series of grim vignettes showcasing the horrors of this lawless land. Raghoul and Musashi encounter a traumatized orphan girl, whose father was murdered for a pouch of coins. Prodded by Musashi, Raghoul gives her water but refuses any deeper connection. They later discover a mass grave of people who were buried alive by a local gang, marked with a "traitor's mark."

The central conflict occurs when they find the same gang dragging another young girl away. Raghoul, urged on by Musashi's goading, confronts them. The gang's leader taunts him, but Raghoul unleashes his blood-red flame and slaughters the entire squad with brutal efficiency, saving the girl. He tells her simply to "stay alive" before she flees.

Back at Musashi's makeshift clinic, filled with the dying and wounded, Musashi confronts Raghoul, telling him he has the power to heal as well as kill. After a moment of internal conflict, Raghoul places his hands on a dying woman and, for the first time, uses his flame not to destroy, but to heal, searing her wounds shut and saving her life.

The chapter ends with a quiet conversation between the two. Raghoul asks Musashi why he bothers helping a "monster" like him. Musashi explains that he saw a "spark" in Raghoul and believes even the coldest flames can provide warmth. He offers to teach Raghoul how to control his power for more than just destruction. For the first time, a flicker of hope appears in Raghoul as he agrees to try.
