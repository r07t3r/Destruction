**Chapter 38: The Devil's Due**

The Cinderborn were pathetic.

Raghoul stood before them, a small army of broken souls. They looked like smoke, like half-forgotten memories. Their faces were smudges of ash, their bodies thin and see-through. They drifted on the wind, their movements slow and sad. They were hungry, but they had forgotten how to eat. They were in pain, but they had forgotten how to scream.

He had felt a flicker of pity for them at first. A small, weak thing in his chest that felt like an old wound. He remembered being weak. He remembered being hungry.

But pity was a luxury. And he was done with luxuries.

"You are mine now," he said, his voice quiet but hard. It cut through the silence of the Ashen Wastes, and the Cinderborn shivered. They drifted closer, drawn to his power like moths to a flame. They had no choice. He was their master now.

But they were weak. And Raghoul had no use for weak things.

He raised his hand. The red flame, his curse and his gift, bloomed in his his palm. It was different now, mixed with the power of the Dragon Vein. It was hotter, brighter, and it felt... alive.

He reached out and touched the nearest Cinderborn.

The soul-creature flinched, but it did not burn. It did not turn to ash. Instead, the red flame flowed into it, like water into a dry sponge. The Cinderborn began to glow from the inside, a deep, angry red.

Its form, once smoky and uncertain, began to harden. The smudged face sharpened, the see-through body became solid. It looked less like a ghost and more like a statue carved from cooling lava. Its eyes, once empty sockets, now burned with a red light.

It was still a monster. But now, it was *his* monster.

He moved to the next one, and the next, his flame flowing from one to the other. He was not just commanding them. He was remaking them. He was burning away their old pain, their old memories, and filling the empty spaces with his own fire, his own will.

It was like being a blacksmith, but instead of forging steel, he was forging souls. And with each soul he reforged, he felt his own power grow. He was not just a conqueror. He was a creator. A dark god building his own angels from the ashes of the damned.

When he was done, the Cinderborn were no longer pathetic. They stood before him, a legion of silent, red-eyed soldiers, their bodies hard as obsidian, their eyes burning with his own fire. They were not hungry anymore. They were not in pain. They were just... waiting.

Waiting for his command.

Raghoul looked at his new army, and for the first time in a long time, he felt something that was almost like pride.

He had taken the broken things of this world and made them strong.

He had taken the forgotten souls and given them a purpose.

His purpose.

With his new army at his back, Raghoul began to walk.

He wanted to see this place, this first layer of Hell. He wanted to understand the kingdom he was about to conquer.

The Ashen Wastes were more than just a desert of bone-dust. As they marched, the landscape began to change. They crossed a river, but the river was not made of water. It was thick and slow and black, and it smelled of sadness. Raghoul could feel the sorrow radiating from it, the grief of a million souls who had wept into its waters. He called it the River of Tears.

They passed through a forest, but the trees were not made of wood. They were made of stone, twisted into shapes of screaming faces and grasping hands. The wind whispered through their stone branches, and it sounded like the last words of dying men. Raghoul named it the Forest of Screams.

They saw cities in the distance, but they were not cities of the living. They were ruins, half-buried in the ashen sand. Towers that reached for a sky that was not there. Palaces with broken walls and empty windows. These were the cities of people who had been damned, their homes pulled into Hell with them, a permanent reminder of all they had lost.

Raghoul walked through these dead cities, his new army following in silent obedience. He saw thrones made of bone, and tapestries woven from human hair. He saw playgrounds where the swings were made of chains, and the merry-go-rounds were made of sharpened blades.

It was a world of pain, a world of suffering, a world of unending despair.

And Raghoul felt... at home.

This place made sense to him. This was a world that did not pretend to be anything other than what it was. It was honest in its cruelty. It was pure in its despair.

He felt a connection to this place, a kinship with the damned souls who had built it. They had suffered, just as he had suffered. They had lost everything, just as he had lost everything.

But they had given up. They had let their pain turn them into pathetic, drifting ghosts.

He would not make that mistake.

He would take his pain and turn it into a weapon. He would take his suffering and turn it into a throne. He would take this world of despair and make it his own.

He was not just a visitor here. He was the new king. And it was time for his subjects to meet him.

---

As they emerged from the Forest of Screams, a figure blocked their path.

It was not like the Cinderborn, nor was it like the Heralds. This creature was... more.

It stood a full head taller than Raghoul, its body a lean, muscular frame of obsidian-black flesh. It wore no armor, save for a series of brass rings that pierced its skin in intricate, painful-looking patterns. Its face was long and angular, with high cheekbones and a cruel, intelligent mouth. Its eyes were pools of molten gold, and from its back sprouted a pair of magnificent, bat-like wings. In its hand, it held a whip made of what looked like braided lightning.

This was Xaphan, the Herald of the Brass Citadel, Duke Asmodeus's most favored lieutenant. And he was not impressed.

"So," Xaphan said, his voice a smooth, cultured baritone that was somehow more menacing than a roar. "You are the one who has been making all the noise."

He looked past Raghoul at the army of forged souls, a flicker of something that might have been interest in his golden eyes. "You have taken the broken things of this realm and given them a new shape. A new purpose. I confess, I am intrigued."

"I am not here to entertain you," Raghoul said, his voice flat.

Xaphan chuckled. "No, I suppose you are not. You are here to conquer. To rule. A bold ambition, for one so... new."

He took a step forward, the lightning whip crackling in his hand. "But this is not your kingdom to take. This land belongs to Duke Asmodeus. And he does not suffer rivals."

"He will learn to," Raghoul said.

The fight began not with a charge, but with a sudden, deafening silence. The wind stopped. The whispers of the damned went quiet. The very air seemed to hold its breath.

Then Xaphan moved.

He was fast, faster than anything Raghoul had ever faced. He closed the distance between them in a heartbeat, the lightning whip a blur of motion as it lashed out. Raghoul barely had time to raise his arm, his red flame flaring to meet the attack.

The impact was like a thunderclap. The ground beneath them shattered, and a shockwave of energy ripped through the Ashen Wastes, turning the bone-dust to glass.

Raghoul was thrown back, his arm numb and tingling. Xaphan had not even flinched.

"Your fire is strong," the demon said, his voice still calm, still amused. "But it is raw. Untrained. You are like a child swinging a sword that is too heavy for him."

He attacked again, this time with a series of quick, precise strikes. The lightning whip was everywhere at once, a cage of energy that seemed to have no openings. Raghoul was forced onto the defensive, his flames flaring wildly as he blocked and parried, the ground around him turning into a crater of scorched earth.

This was not like fighting the Heralds. This was not a simple matter of overwhelming power. Xaphan was a true warrior, a master of his craft. And he was toying with Raghoul.

"You rely too much on your gift," Xaphan said, his voice a low murmur as he pressed his attack. "You have forgotten the fundamentals. The art of the blade. The dance of death."

He feinted with the whip, and as Raghoul moved to block, Xaphan was suddenly inside his guard, a short, wicked-looking blade in his other hand. The blade plunged into Raghoul's side, and for the first time in a long time, he felt a pain that was not of his own making.

He staggered back, his hand flying to the wound, his eyes wide with a surprise that was quickly turning to rage.

"There," Xaphan said, a cruel smile playing on his lips. "That is the look I was hoping for. The look of a god remembering that he can bleed."

Raghoul's rage exploded.

The red flame erupted from him in a tidal wave of destruction, a raw, uncontrolled torrent of power that washed over the battlefield. His army of forged souls charged forward, their red eyes burning with a shared fury.

But Xaphan was ready.

He spread his wings, and a wall of black energy rose to meet the flame. The two forces collided with a sound that tore the sky apart, a symphony of destruction. The forged souls crashed against the wall, their obsidian bodies shattering into a million pieces.

Raghoul was on his knees, his breath coming in ragged gasps, the pain in his side a fire that was threatening to consume him. He had underestimated his opponent. He had let his newfound power make him arrogant.

And now, he was paying the price.

"It is a pity," Xaphan said, walking slowly towards him, the lightning whip crackling with anticipation. "You had potential. But potential is not the same as power. And power... power belongs to the strong."

He raised the whip for the final blow.

And in that moment, as he stared into the face of his own defeat, Raghoul remembered.

He remembered the desert, and the pain, and the hunger. He remembered the old monk, and the lessons he had learned at his feet. He remembered the feel of a blade in his hand, the weight of it, the cold certainty of it.

He had been a warrior long before he had become a god.

He had just... forgotten.

As the lightning whip descended, Raghoul moved. Not with the raw, explosive power of his flame, but with the quiet, deadly grace of a master swordsman. He drew the blade he had not used since he entered this realm, a simple, unadorned katana that seemed to absorb the light around it.

The whip and the sword met, and this time, there was no explosion. No shockwave. Just a single, clear note that hung in the air like a prayer.

Xaphan's golden eyes widened in surprise.

Raghoul smiled, a true smile this time, full of the cold, hard joy of battle.

"The lesson is not over," he said.

The duel that followed was a masterpiece of violence. It was a dance of fire and lightning, of steel and shadow. Raghoul was no longer just a wielder of flame. He was a warrior, his blade an extension of his will, his movements precise and deadly.

He flowed around Xaphan's attacks, his katana a blur of motion. He used the demon's own momentum against him, turning his strength into a weakness. He was no longer just fighting. He was hunting.

Xaphan, for his part, was no longer amused. He was fighting for his life, his arrogance replaced by a grim, desperate focus. He summoned legions of lesser demons, their shadowy forms rising from the ground to swarm Raghoul.

But Raghoul's forged souls, those that remained, met them head-on, a wall of obsidian and red fire.

The battle raged for what felt like an eternity. The Ashen Wastes were transformed into a hellscape of shattered earth and molten glass. The sky itself seemed to bleed, the clouds turning a deep, bruised purple.

And in the end, it came down to a single moment.

Raghoul and Xaphan stood facing each other, both bleeding, both exhausted, but both unwilling to yield.

"You are... impressive," Xaphan admitted, his voice a hoarse whisper. "But you cannot win. This is my realm. My power here is absolute."

He raised his hands, and the very ground of Hell seemed to rise to his command. The bone-dust swirled into a massive, skeletal golem, its eyes burning with green fire.

"Behold the wrath of the Ashen Wastes," Xaphan said. "And despair."

The golem charged, its footsteps shaking the very foundations of the world.

Raghoul did not move. He simply closed his eyes and breathed.

And when he opened them again, the red flame was gone.

In its place was something else. Something older. Something darker.

A flame as black as the void between stars, a fire that did not burn, but consumed.

He raised his hand, and the black flame shot forward, not as a wave, but as a single, focused point of absolute nothingness.

It hit the golem in the chest, and the massive creature of bone and despair simply... vanished. Not even dust remained.

Xaphan stared, his golden eyes wide with a terror that was almost beautiful.

"What... what is that?" he whispered.

"The end," Raghoul said.

The black flame touched Xaphan, and the Herald of the Brass Citadel, the favored of Asmodeus, the master of the lightning whip, was gone.

Raghoul stood alone on the battlefield, the black flame dancing on his fingertips. He had won. He had proven his strength.

But the victory felt... hollow.

He had been forced to unleash a power he did not understand, a power that frightened even him. He had looked into the abyss, and the abyss had looked back.

He turned his gaze to the horizon, to the distant, unseen Brass Citadel.

This was not the end. This was just the beginning.

And the road ahead was paved with a darkness that was even deeper than he had imagined.
