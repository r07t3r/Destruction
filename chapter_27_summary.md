(Chapter 27: "The Masquerade of a Thousand Lies")
Expanded Summary
The chapter introduces a new protagonist and setting: Jin, a young, resourceful thief living in the slums of the opulent, canal-filled "Metal City." His primary motivation is to earn enough money to buy his younger sister, Mei, out of servitude to a local gang leader named Old Crow. His target is Lady Amira Yellowstone, a powerful noblewoman hosting a masquerade ball. Jin plans to infiltrate the party and plant a listening device to gather intelligence he can sell.

Disguised as a flower boy, Jin successfully gets past the guards and enters the lavish party. He navigates the crowd of masked nobles, locating Lady Amira's private pavilion. While pretending to arrange flowers, he overhears a critical conversation. Lady Amira is desperate to secure a "Celestial Accord" with the city's hidden council to save her family's trading empire and aid the "Earth Nation." To ensure the council's compliance, she plans to use an illegal, mind-controlling drug called "sun-fire elixir."

As Jin attempts to plant his listening crystal, he is caught by Lady Amira and a mysterious hooded man who has been observing him. The man reveals he knows everything about Jin's plan and his sister's predicament. Instead of punishing him, Lady Amira and the hooded man make him an offer he can't refuse: they will pay him enough to free Mei and start a new life if he helps them. The job is to deliver the sun-fire elixir to the council meeting the following night. They make it clear that refusal is not an option, as they have the power to ensure Mei is sold off by Old Crow's gang.

Jin is left with an impossible choice: help Lady Amira commit a terrible crime that could lead to war, or risk his sister's life. He is given a down payment and sent away, the threat hanging over his head. As he walks back to the slums through the steaming city streets, he reflects on Lady Amira's willingness to "burn this city to save my people" and realizes they are not so different, as they are both willing to do terrible things to protect those they love. The chapter ends with him grappling with his decision as fireworks, like "poisonous flowers," bloom over the city.
