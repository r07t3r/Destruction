(Chapter 20: "To Build on Corpses")
Expanded Summary
The chapter is a grim, atmospheric piece that follows the early days of the Akatsuki, a group of idealists trying to build a new society from the ashes of the Land of Rain. The narrative is told from the perspective of an unnamed, cynical member (implied to be an early associate or a disillusioned member like Kakuzu or an OC) who observes the unfolding tragedy.

The chapter opens with the Akatsuki and their small group of followers visiting the ruins of Asugamuzi, a village annihilated by Hanzo's mycotoxin. The scene is a visceral hellscape: the ground is blackened, and the canals are choked with the bloated, fused corpses of children and families. The air is thick with the smell of decay and the lingering poison. Konan, heartbroken, places paper flowers on the dead, a futile gesture of beauty in a place of absolute horror.

Here, Yahiko, the Akatsuki's passionate leader, gives a powerful speech to his followers. Standing amidst the carnage, he condemns not just Hanzo, but all the Great Nations, accusing them of feeding on war and profiting from the deaths of innocents. He declares their intention to build something different, a city in the open where children won't have to be soldiers. When a bitter survivor questions building on corpses, Yahiko retorts, "Where else? This is all they left us."

The group then travels to the site that will become Amegakure. Their arrival is met with hostility and fear from the local populace, who see them as just another group of shinobi, synonymous with death and destruction. They are pelted with stones and cursed as "baby-killers." The narrator is filled with rage at their ingratitude, but a moment of clarity comes when he sees a young girl with a melted face, a victim of the toxin, looking at him with pure terror. He understands that to these people, all shinobi are monsters.

The "foundation" of their new city is a desperate, squalid affair. It's a refugee camp built from scrap, populated by the dregs of society: deserters, prostitutes, and orphans. The scene is one of profound misery and social decay, with people fighting, using drugs, and children playing with human remains. Konan moves among them like a silent, grieving angel, while Yahiko stands on a half-built wall, the very picture of a tragic messiah.

The chapter ends with a conversation between the narrator and Nagato. Nagato, looking at the human misery below, questions if this is what they saved these people for. The narrator, fully embracing his cynicism, replies that this "garbage" is all they have to work with. When Nagato asks if they can make something beautiful from it, the narrator looks at Yahiko's idealistic form and thinks, "No. But we can make something terrible."

Plot Point Analysis

    *   **Significance:** This grounds the Akatsuki's idealism in a tangible, horrific context. Their desire for peace is not an abstract philosophy; it is a direct reaction to the absolute worst of humanity.

*   **Yahiko's Founding Ideology:** Yahiko's speech at Asugamuzi clearly articulates the Akatsuki's mission and their condemnation of the entire shinobi world order.

*   **The Rejection by the People:** The hostility the Akatsuki faces from the civilians they are trying to save is a critical reality check.
